neeed to ghet get user guess to draw all the buttons

get their input and push that to the guess game

"current state"

game runs pushing value "1234" to it
once quit
runs draw app
if red button is press and then the game is quit
runs the master mind game but pushes a different squeance to game


while legnth of array is less then 4

lopp VVV

event click button add(button option to array)
repeart

once array is equal to 4 exit while loop

convert array to string and pass to guess


update 19/4/19 ///////////////////////////////////////////////

need to build a new class, to push the guess to based on the gamelogic class which
then will need to return to the main loop to guess again


move the guess operation in to it's own class and treat each guess as it's own object to be pushed to game logic
untill the player guesses right

Update 20/4/19

code breaker logic and userguesss are working, need to tidy up the user interface,

display the guess result on screen as well but almost there!!!

plus do alot of code refactoring and renaming. 


update 22/4/19

create a interface that has a list field that adds everything that needs to be drawn to the window,
then use a for wach loop to draw all inhearded classes. 

update 29/4/19

deleted the unneeded class,
will need to put each class in the program section in it's own class file.
figure out how to display the time as well. (change time to include mins and seconds)

add in what happens when the user runs out of guesses (add a more creative version)

create a parent class for buttons, shapes(squares) and cicles

still got to refactor the code in user guess, move things to different classes, get the intface to draw everything regardless of what it is
create the delgate for a mouse over event and for a mouse click

idea for displaying the correct time
using System;
using System.Diagnostics;
class MainClass {
  public static void Main (string[] args) {
    Console.WriteLine ("Hello World");
    var timer = new Stopwatch();
    timer.Start();
    
    for(int i = 0; i < 1000000; i++)
    {
      TimeSpan ts = timer.Elapsed;
    string elapsedTime = String.Format("{0:00}:{1:00}:{2:00}.{3:00}",
            ts.Hours, ts.Minutes, ts.Seconds,
            ts.Milliseconds / 10);
        Console.WriteLine("RunTime " + elapsedTime);
    }
  }
}

update 1/05/19

maybe fix the time

maybe create a parent gui creator and then create a new child gui used for the welcome screen, with insurctions

refactor, commet and wrap...

update 3/05/19 

added in the code required to process to hover over event. 

started the code for the welcome screen,

need to add in the logic to exit the welcome screen and also the mouse over for the button. 

update 4/05/19

figure out what to do about the hover on the ready button,

then comment refactor and wrap.
